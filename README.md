# Boxplots
This repository contains a juypter notebook with an investigation into boxplots graphs. 


To run the notebook, you must have Jupyter (http://jupyter.org) installed on your machine. 
You can install this using the Anaconda(https://www.anaconda.org) Python distribution. 

This notebook was developed as part of an assignment for my Data Analytics degree.
